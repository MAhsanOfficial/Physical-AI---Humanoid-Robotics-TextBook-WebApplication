# Preface

Welcome to "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: A Complete Course for Embodied Intelligence"! This textbook embarks on a comprehensive journey into one of the most exciting and rapidly evolving fields of the 21st century: the confluence of artificial intelligence with physical robotic systems, culminating in the design and deployment of humanoid robots.

In an era where AI is transforming every facet of our lives, the integration of intelligent algorithms with physical bodies gives rise to a new paradigm—**Physical AI**. This isn't just about abstract computation; it's about intelligence that perceives, interacts with, and learns from the real world through physical embodiment. It's about robots that can not only think but also *do*, navigating complex environments, performing intricate tasks, and collaborating seamlessly with humans.

This course is designed for university-level students, engineering professionals, and enthusiasts eager to master the theoretical foundations and practical applications of embodied intelligence. We will delve into the critical technologies that underpin this revolution, from the fundamental concepts of robotic operating systems to cutting-edge simulation platforms and advanced perception-action loops.

We firmly believe that understanding the intricate dance between bits and atoms is paramount for shaping the future. Humanoid robots, with their human-like form and capabilities, represent the ultimate challenge and promise of Physical AI. They are not merely tools but potential partners, caregivers, and explorers, poised to redefine industries and daily life.

Prepare to explore, innovate, and build. The journey ahead will equip you with the knowledge and skills to contribute to a future where intelligent machines extend human capabilities and enrich our world.
