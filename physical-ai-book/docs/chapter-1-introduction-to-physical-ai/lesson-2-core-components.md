# Core Components of Physical AI

## Introduction
This lesson breaks down the core components that make up a Physical AI system. Understanding these building blocks is essential for designing and evaluating robotic systems.

## Main Content
A Physical AI system is typically composed of three main hardware components, all driven by a central processing unit (the "brain").

1.  **Sensors**: These are the "senses" of the robot.
    -   *Examples*: Cameras (vision), Microphones (sound), LiDAR (depth), IMUs (orientation), Tactile sensors (touch).
2.  **Actuators**: These are the "muscles" of the robot that allow it to move and interact with the world.
    -   *Examples*: Electric motors, Hydraulic pistons, Servo motors.
3.  **End-Effectors**: These are the "hands" or tools of the robot, attached to the actuators.
    -   *Examples*: Grippers, Suction cups, Welding torches, Drills.

The **Software** or "brain" runs on a processing unit (like a CPU or GPU) and is responsible for implementing the perception, reasoning, and action loop.

## Summary
In this lesson, we identified the three key hardware components of Physical AI: sensors (senses), actuators (muscles), and end-effectors (hands/tools). We also recognized the central role of software in controlling these components.

## Hands-On Exercise
1.  **Research**: Choose a commercially available robot (e.g., Boston Dynamics' Spot, a DJI drone, or a Roomba).
2.  **Identify**: List the specific sensors, actuators, and end-effectors used in your chosen robot. Explain the function of each component.
