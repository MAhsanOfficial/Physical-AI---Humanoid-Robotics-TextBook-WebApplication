# What is Physical AI?

## Introduction
This lesson introduces the fundamental concept of Physical AI. We will explore what it means for an AI to interact with the physical world and why this is a critical area of research and development.

## Main Content
Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence that can perceive, reason about, and interact with the physical environment. Unlike purely digital AI (like chatbots or recommendation engines), Physical AI systems are embodied in some form of robot or device.

Key characteristics include:
- **Perception**: Using sensors like cameras, LiDAR, and tactile sensors to gather data about the world.
- **Reasoning**: Processing sensor data to understand the environment and make decisions.
- **Action**: Executing actions through motors, grippers, and other actuators to affect change in the environment.

## Summary
In this lesson, we defined Physical AI as embodied intelligence that connects the digital and physical worlds. We discussed its core characteristics: perception, reasoning, and action.

## Hands-On Exercise
1.  **Identify**: Find three examples of Physical AI in your home or community (e.g., a robot vacuum, a smart thermostat, a self-checkout machine).
2.  **Analyze**: For each example, describe how it perceives its environment, what decisions it makes, and how it acts on the world.
