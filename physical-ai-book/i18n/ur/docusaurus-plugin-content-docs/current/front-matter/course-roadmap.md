# Course Roadmap

This textbook is designed as a comprehensive course to guide you from foundational concepts to advanced topics in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. The content is structured into seven distinct parts, each building upon the knowledge gained in the preceding sections.

## Learning Path Overview

### PART I — Foundations of Physical AI
*   **Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI**: Defines what Physical AI is, explores Embodied Intelligence, the significance of humanoid robots, and introduces the complete robotics AI stack.
*   **Chapter 2: Humanoid Robotics Overview**: Delves into different types of humanoid robots, their sensory and actuation systems, and examines prominent case studies like Tesla Optimus, Unitree G1, and Figure AI.

### PART II — ROS 2: The Robotic Nervous System
*   **Chapter 3: ROS 2 Fundamentals**: Covers the core architecture of ROS 2, including DDS, nodes, topics, and services, establishing it as the communication backbone for robotics.
*   **Chapter 4: ROS 2 Development in Python**: Focuses on practical development using `rclpy`, teaching how to write control nodes, publish sensor data, and interact with the ROS 2 ecosystem.
*   **Chapter 5: Robot Description**: Explores standard robot description formats like URDF and Xacro, detailing how to define joints, links, inertial properties, and integrate sensors into robot models.

### PART III — Simulation & Digital Twins (Gazebo + Unity)
*   **Chapter 6: Gazebo Simulation**: Introduces Gazebo as a powerful physics simulator, covering world creation, physics engines, sensor modeling, and plugin development.
*   **Chapter 7: Unity Robotics**: Explores Unity's capabilities for high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction, demonstrating how to import robot models and design interactive environments.

### PART IV — NVIDIA Isaac: The AI-Robot Brain
*   **Chapter 8: Isaac Sim**: Deep dives into NVIDIA Isaac Sim, focusing on Universal Scene Description (USD), advanced rendering techniques, and domain randomization for robust training.
*   **Chapter 9: Isaac ROS**: Covers Isaac ROS modules for VSLAM, perception, object detection, and integrating Nav2 for humanoid navigation within the Isaac ecosystem.

### PART V — Vision-Language-Action Systems
*   **Chapter 10: Voice-to-Action**: Explores systems like Whisper for voice input, intent extraction, and mapping natural language commands to robotic actions.
*   **Chapter 11: LLM-based Robotics**: Discusses leveraging Large Language Models for high-level task planning and translating natural language instructions into concrete ROS actions for robot execution.

### PART VI — Humanoid Robotics Engineering
*   **Chapter 12: Humanoid Kinematics**: Focuses on the forward and inverse kinematics of humanoid robots, specifically for arms, legs, and torso, crucial for precise movement control.
*   **Chapter 13: Dynamics & Balance**: Addresses the complex topics of Zero Moment Point (ZMP), Center of Mass (COM), and gait cycle generation for stable bipedal locomotion.
*   **Chapter 14: Manipulation**: Covers grasping strategies and hand-eye coordination for humanoid robots to interact with and manipulate objects in their environment.

### PART VII — Capstone Project
*   **Chapter 15: The Autonomous Humanoid**: Integrates all learned concepts into a comprehensive capstone project, demonstrating a humanoid robot capable of voice input, task planning, navigation, object recognition, and manipulation.
